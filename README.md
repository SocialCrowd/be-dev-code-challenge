# Guidelines
Please choose one of the following four projects.

The intent is to gain a better understanding of your coding style and thought processes.

Projects should be in either Python or Ruby (Ruby preferably), executable from the command line, and saved to github.

Please include the Project Details in the readme.

If you feel some of the instructions could be enhanced or clarified, go for it!  Just make a note of the changes in the readme.


# Project 1: Weather Data Processor
## Objective: Create a command-line application that processes and displays weather data.
## Instructions:
1.	Data Generation: The application should generate random weather data for different cities. Each data point should include temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
2.	Object-Oriented Design: Implement classes and/or modules to represent different aspects of the weather data (e.g., City, WeatherReport).
3.	Configuration: Use a YAML file to configure the list of cities and any other parameters (like the range of possible temperature values).
4.	Output: The processed data should be displayed in JSON format on the console.
5.	Interactivity: Allow the user to specify a city and date range for which they want to see the weather report.
6.	Documentation: Write clear comments and documentation for your code.
## Evaluation Criteria:
•	Code organization and style.
•	Use of object-oriented principles.
•	Handling of external configuration.
•	Clarity of documentation and comments.

# Project 2: Stock Portfolio Simulator
## Objective: Develop a command-line tool to simulate a stock portfolio.
## Instructions:
1.	Data Generation: Randomly generate stock prices for a predefined set of companies.
2.	Object-Oriented Design: Create classes to represent Stock, Portfolio, and StockMarket.
3.	Configuration: Use a YAML file for initial settings like the list of companies, initial stock prices, and simulation parameters.
4.	Output: Display the portfolio's performance in JSON format, including the value of each stock and total value.
5.	Interactivity: Allow users to 'buy' or 'sell' stocks and see the updated portfolio.
6.	Documentation: Write clear comments and documentation for your code.
## Evaluation Criteria:
•	Elegance and clarity of the code.
•	Effective use of object-oriented design.
•	Configurability and use of external YAML file.
•	Code readability and documentation.

# Project 3: Library Management System
## Objective: Build a simple command-line library management system.
## Instructions:
1.	Data Generation: Automatically generate a list of books and authors. Each book should have properties like title, author, and ISBN.
2.	Object-Oriented Design: Implement classes such as Book, Author, and Library.
3.	Configuration: Externalize library settings (e.g., opening hours, maximum borrow limit) in a YAML file.
4.	Output: Provide functionality to display the library catalog in JSON format on the command line.
5.	Interactivity: Enable user interactions like searching for a book, checking out, and returning books.
6.	Documentation: Write clear comments and documentation for your code.
## Evaluation Criteria:
•	Code structure and adherence to object-oriented principles.
•	Efficient handling of the YAML configuration file.
•	Clarity and usefulness of the JSON output.
•	Readability and documentation of the code.

# Project 4: Event Scheduler and Reminder
## Objective: Create a command-line tool that allows users to schedule and be reminded of events.
## Instructions:
1.	Data Generation: Users can create events with details like title, date, and description.
2.	Object-Oriented Design: Develop classes like Event, Calendar, and Reminder.
3.	Configuration: Store settings like reminder lead time and default event durations in a YAML file.
4.	Output: Display upcoming events and reminders in JSON format.
5.	Interactivity: Allow users to add, delete, and list events. Implement a reminder system that alerts users of upcoming events.
6.	Documentation: Write clear comments and documentation for your code.
## Evaluation Criteria:
•	Application of object-oriented concepts in code.
•	Effective use of external configuration files.
•	The functionality and format of the JSON output.
•	Code readability and comprehensive documentation.
